## Introduction
This is a code repository for the COVID-19 Tracker

In this video, we will create a full COVID-19 Tracker. We're going to use React, Charts.JS and Material UI.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```

## Please Note this:

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers/engineers, do to make the situation better? 

We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. Along the way, you'll learn how to use Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, API data fetching, all of it in React JS!

The project is going to fetch the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. In this project, we also use React Hooks! 

## Disclaimer: 
The API used has stopped displaying the daily values. The whole project still works absolutely fine. If you want to have the daily data (and a corresponding chart), I found the API that offers the daily data for the US and implemented it. All necessary changes that you need to make are in this GitHub commit - http://bit.ly/DailyDataFix.
